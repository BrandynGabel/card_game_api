# card_game_api
An API for making card games written in C++


How to use:

In your main function declare a Dealer, Table, and as many Hand (players) as needed.
A Dealer will come with a shuffled Deck automatically. You should not have to use
the Deck or exception classes directly, although you should try-catch the exceptions

Use the functions as needed in order to write the rules for your game in your main function.
